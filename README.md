1-4, Run the app, and it will crash. Tha hacky way to fix this issue is to open simulator and go to the messenger app. Select a conversation and on the bottom of the page click on the ... to add more stickers. Then on the top right click on "Edit" and enable our newly created app. Now you should be able to send this sticker or attach it to any conversation bubble you like.
